\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:101-swanton-abstract}

Another version of story 67.

A very succeessful fur-seal hunter was driven to a rock far out to sea where there was a great abundance of sea animals.
After some months he and his companions set out on their return, guiding themselves by the sun.
At length they came in sight of the summit of Mount Edgecumbe and later of Verstovaia.
They rested on Kruzof island, and then came to Dax̣ē′t, where the people were camping, and were received joyfully.
The elder of the two wives had grieved for him all this time and was the first to catch sight of him, but the younger had married again and now felt very much ashamed.
