\chapter{Tlʼanaxéedáḵw: Wealth Woman}\label{ch:94-wealth-woman}

This narrative was told to \citeauthor{swanton:1909} by \fm{Daawoolsʼéesʼ} Don Cameron in Sitka in 1904.
In \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s original publication it is number 94, running from page 292 to 293 and totalling 16 lines of glossed transcription.
The Tlingit name of this story is \fm{Tlʼanaxéedáḵw} which is the name of the mythical figure featured in this story.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909} did not translate the name, giving the story as “The ʟ!ênᴀxx̣ī′dᴀq” using his transcription.
Some common names in English for \fm{Tlʼanaxéedáḵw} are ‘Wealth Woman’, ‘Lucky Lady’, and ‘Property Woman’, but none of these is a literal translation.

Like several other narratives in \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s collection, this narrative is quite short.
It is however well known and has been recorded many times from other Tlingit people.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909} has a more detailed version of the same story in English from \fm{Kasáankʼw} as number 35 in his collection, recorded in Wrangell in 1904 \parencite[173–175]{swanton:1909}.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909} also records a mention of her at the end of his number 105 for which see \FIXME{xref to ch.\ \ref{ch:105-kwaashkikhwaan-history}}. 
Anatolii Kamenskii recorded another version in Russian some time before 1906 from an unnamed consultant in Sitka \parencites{kamenskii:1906}[68–70]{kamenskii-kan:1985}.
Viola Garfield provides some notes in English about \fm{Tlʼanaxéedáḵw} from an unknown consultant in 1939, given in the context of a totem pole in Klawock that also features the \fm{G̱unakadeit} mythical creature \parencite[117–118]{garfield-forrest:1948}.
Frederica de Laguna has a version from \fm{Ḵaajaaḵw} Jack Ellis and another from \fm{Shaawát Ḵʼwás} Emma Ellis, both in English, which she recorded in Yakutat in 1954 \parencite[884]{de-laguna:1972}.
Jeff Leer published a version in Tlingit which he recorded in 1988 from \fm{Seidayaa} Elizabeth Nyman \parencite[218–255]{nyman:1993}.
Catharine McClellan recorded five versions in English, one from \fm{Ltʼaanéekaneek} Patsy Henderson \parencite[238–241]{mcclellan-cruikshank:2007b}, two from \fm{Stéew} Angela Sidney \parencite[344–348, 348–353]{mcclellan-cruikshank:2007b}, one from \fm{Yeilnaawú} Tom Peters \parencite[715–719]{mcclellan-cruikshank:2007c}, and one from \fm{Neildayéen} Edgar Sidney \parencite[747–753]{mcclellan-cruikshank:2007c}.
In addition McClellan recorded a personal story of \fm{Ltʼaanéekaneek} Patsy Henderson hearing the \fm{Tlʼanaxéedáḵw} \parencite[241–244]{mcclellan-cruikshank:2007b}.
Aside from these published versions there are also unpublished audio recordings;
the Dauenhauer collection has at least four recordings of the story that await transcription: \fm{Yeilnaawú} Tom Peters in 1973 (tape 42 side \textsc{a}), \fm{Keiḵóokʼw} George Jim in 1970 (tape 91 side \textsc{b}), and \fm{Kéet Yanaayí} Willie Marks in 1976 (tape 75) and 1980 (tape 324 side \textsc{a}).

In a footnote \citeauthor{swanton:1909} explicitly connects \fm{Tlʼanaxéedáḵw} to the Haida “Skîl djā′adai” that he translates as “Property Woman” \parencite[292 fn.\ a]{swanton:1909}.
\citeauthor{enrico:2005} gives this name as \fm{Skils Jaadaay} [\ipa{skils tʃaːtaːj}] in Skidegate and \fm{Skil Jaadee} [\ipa{skil tʃaːteː}] in Masset, both meaning ‘Wealth Woman’ \parencite[525]{enrico:2005}.
\citeauthor{swanton:1905a} offers some details about her in his ethnography of the Haida \parencite[29]{swanton:1905a} and she is mentioned in a couple of stories he recorded \parencites{swanton:1905b}{swanton:1908a} though none of these are strictly about her.

\citeauthor{boas:1916} notes that the Tsimshian narrative from Henry Tate called “Plucking Out Eyes” \parencite[154–158]{boas:1916} is “practically identical” to the Tlingit narratives that \citeauthor{swanton:1909} collected \parencite[746]{boas:1916}.
\citeauthor{boas:1916} also says that the same incident of the child taking out people’s eyes happens as part of the Skidegate Raven stories \parencite[111]{swanton:1905b} and the Masset Raven stories \parencite[143]{swanton:1905b}, but this is not directly connected to the Wealth Woman.

\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:94-swanton-abstract}

A man saw a woman and two children floating in Auk lake, and he captured one of the children and brought it home.
During the night the child gouged out the eyes of all the people living in the village except one woman, and ate them.
This woman killed the child, and taking on her back her own child, to which she had just given birth, she went up into the woods and became the ʟ!ê′naxx̣ī′dᴀq.
As she went along she ate mussels and fitted the shells together.

\section{Swanton’s translation}\label{sec:94-swanton-translation}

\pgnum{292}
A man at Auk went out on the lake after firewood.
On the way round it he saw a woman floating about.
Her hair was long.
Looking at her for some time, he saw that her little ones were with her.
He took one of the children home.
When it became dark they went to sleep.
It was the child of the ʟ!ê′nᴀxx̣ī′dᴀq, and that night it went through the town picking out people’s eyes.
Toward morning a certain woman bore a child.
In the morning, when she was getting up, this [the ʟ!ê′nᴀxx̣ī′dᴀq’s child] came in to her into the house.
The small boy had a big belly full of eyes.
He had taken out the eyes of all the people.
That woman to whom the small boy came had a cane.
He kept pointing at her eyes.
Then she pushed him away with the cane.
When he had done it twice, she pushed it into him.
He was all full of eyes.
After she had killed him the woman went through the
\pgnum{293}
houses.
Then she began to dress herself up.
She took her child up on her back to start wandering.
She said, “I am going to be the ʟ!ê′nᴀxx̣ī′dᴀq.”
When she came down on the beach she kept eating mussels.
She put the shells inside of one another.
As she walks along she nurses her little child.
