\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:94-swanton-abstract}

A man saw a woman and two children floating in Auk lake, and he captured one of the children and brought it home.
During the night the child gouged out the eyes of all the people living in the village except one woman, and ate them.
This woman killed the child, and taking on her back her own child, to which she had just given birth, she went up into the woods and became the ʟ!ê′naxx̣ī′dᴀq.
As she went along she ate mussels and fitted the shells together.
