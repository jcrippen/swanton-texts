When the Kˆîksᴀ′dî first reached Sitka some people, called Sky people, killed all of them except one woman who concealed herself in a cave.
She called for some one to marry her, and, after having refused all the animals, married the sun’s son.
By him she had four boys and a girl, and their grandfather placed them inside of a fort which he let down on the site of their former village.
Then the enemy came upon them, and when they were in danger, their grandfather heated the land so hot that the enemy ran down into the sea.
They found that boiling hot also and were destroyed.
