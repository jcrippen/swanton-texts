\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:97-swanton-abstract}

In order to destroy a malevolent shaman four brothers let their sister marry him, took her back, and got her to tell them the location of her husband’s heart.
They killed him outside of Ring island, Sitka sound, and took away his red-snapper coat.
One of these brothers, named Łq!ayā′k!, then put this on and used it in the pursuit of large animals.
By and by he pursued an animal up into the sky and his footprints formed the Milky Way. [Footnote: This is part of a longer story of which story 3 \parencite[22–25]{swanton:1909} is one version while a second is contained in story 31 \parencite[99–106]{swanton:1909}.]
