\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:98-swanton-abstract}

Another version of story 37.

A woman at Sitka refused to give her mother-in-law herring, and when she held out her hand for some, dropped the hot milt of a male herring into her hand and burned it.
When her son came home the old woman told him.
Then the son went out in his canoe, brought in a load of herring, and told his wife to go down and bring it up.
She went down without her basket, and began calling to them to bring it to her.
As they paid no attention, she kept on calling, and she called all night.
Finally her voice changed to the hooting of an owl, and she also changed into an owl.
