\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:92-swanton-abstract}

Another version of 65.

Two girls ate between meals, contrary to the tabus, and their mother scratched the inside of the mouth of the elder and scolded them both.
Among other things she told them that they could not marry Mountain Dweller.
Then the girls ran away, and after wandering for some time, came to Mountain Dweller, who married them.
While they were there their mother-in-law killed them becauser they looked at her while she was eating, but Mountain Dweller killed her in turn and restored them to life.
After that they went to their father’s town, and their husband accompanied them, carrying a magic basket which contained an enormous amount of food, and yet was made small enough to be carried on his thumb.
Afterward they killed their mother in revenge.
