\chapter{Shaakanaayí: Mountain Dweller}\label{ch:92-mountain-dweller}

\section{Swanton’s abstract}\label{sec:92-swanton-abstract}

Another version of 65.

Two girls ate between meals, contrary to the tabus, and their mother scratched the inside of the mouth of the elder and scolded them both.
Among other things she told them that they could not marry Mountain Dweller.
Then the girls ran away, and after wandering for some time, came to Mountain Dweller, who married them.
While they were there their mother-in-law killed them becauser they looked at her while she was eating, but Mountain Dweller killed her in turn and restored them to life.
After that they went to their father’s town, and their husband accompanied them, carrying a magic basket which contained an enormous amount of food, and yet was made small enough to be carried on his thumb.
Afterward they killed their mother in revenge.

\section{Swanton’s translation}\label{sec:92-swanton-translation}

A chief was living with his two children in the middle of a long town.
People were always visiting him, and he kept tallow stored away for strangers.
By and by a big canoe came to him, and [the peoples’] things were taken up.
{}[The children’s] grandmother had charge of the tallow.
She always had things stored away for strangers.
Then she would give these to her grandchildren.
Afterward the old woman would say,
“The old shaggy dog took it away from me.”
After that he invited the foreign people up.
He ordered the tallow in the big box to be brought for them.
Now there was nothing inside of the big box.
The foreign people, however, were all seated.
It was thought that his children had done it.
They had invited them for the food that was all eaten up.
This is why people say even now,
\{281\} “They came to invite for the food that was gone.”
It was entirely empty, and great was the shame that the chief felt.
Afterward he questioned his children.
Their dishes had hair on them.
There was a dish apiece, which always lay by them.
Then their mother came in to them.
“Did you do this?”
she said.
When they kept on crying, she raised the face of the older girl.
She scratched her daughter’s cheek, and also that of the younger one.
She scratched on both of their cheeks because they ate up the tallow for which [her husband] had invited strangers.
When the people went to bed that night the girls made a hole under the boards.
Then they put the hairy dishes in their places.
Afterward they went back into a hollow tree.

Next morning [their mother] said,
“I wonder where they have gone.”
She said to them,
“Getupnow.”
Then the long dishes moved [as she pulled at the covers].
It was the dishes they had put in their places.
They, however, had dug a hole underneath and were gone.
Then their mother came out from behind the screens.
No one knew \{282\} whither they had gone.
Afterward they went straight up into the woods.
And after they had started [the people] rushed up to hunt for them, but they hid themselves.
The younger kept saying to the elder,
“Let us make some kind of noise for our mother.”
She answered,
“How does the inside of your cheeks feel?”
She kept saying to her younger sister,
“Oh! we can not do it.
She said to us,
‘Let Mountain Dweller marry both of you.’
I know what she was saying to us.”

For this reason they went far up into the woods.
They wandered along, aimlessly crying.
The younger sister wanted her elder sister to go back to the place from which they had started, but she did not want her mother to see her down there.
After they had gone a long distance they saw a small mouse running across a log.
The mouse went into a little hill.
Then her younger sister said,
“Grandmother mouse, people have seen you.”
So said her younger sister.
“Put me quickly across this log,”
said the little mouse.
“My grandmother says
‘Call them into the house.’”
On account of that it had run out.
\{283\}
Then the door flew open.
They [entered and] sat down.%
\footnote{\{Swanton’s footnote \textit{a}\}
The story is very much condensed here.
The mouse’s “grandmother” had sent it to invite them in.
The mouse asks to be put over the log because the entrance to her grandmother’s house was on the other side.
“On account of that she had run out” refers to the mouse’s first appearance.}
“Why did you come?”
she said to them.
After they had been seated for some time she pushed something between her teeth, and got something out.
It was a piece of dried fish.
She shook it.
It was now a spring salmon taken from between her teeth, and they placed it by the fire.
She set it before them, and they consumed it.
She took a cranberry out from between her teeth.
She placed it before them, and they consumed that.
After they had eaten she said again,
“Why did you come, my little grandchildren?”
and the elder replied,
“My mother said we could not marry Mountain Dweller.”
“He is a very difficult person to get near.
Go now my little grandchildren.”
Then she told them what to do.
“Crushing-mountain is before the place, granddaughters, and also the fighting dogs (cᴀk!).”
She also said,
“Kelps float together in front of it.
Take your knife and a whetstone with you,”
she said.
After she had instructed them they started out.
When they had gone along for
\{284\}
some time they saw the fighting dogs.
They threw a piece of dried fish bone to them, and the dogs began to divide it.
Again they went forward.
Before they had gone far they came upon kelps floating together.
They threw moss between.
Then they passed through.
After that they saw Crushing-mountain.
(Just the way people tell this I am telling you, my opposite clansman.)
They threw a whetstone between 
They went through.
Now they saw the camp.
They came to the house door.

Mountain Dweller’s mother was at home.
Nothing could be seen inside of this house, there was so much fat.
They were told they could not get into Mountain Dweller’s house.
That is why they went there.
After they had been seated for some time they were given something to eat.
By and by the hunter brought in a load of food.
He asked his mother,
“What are those people that have come to you doing?”
“They came to marry you because it was said that they could not.”
So Mountain Dweller married both of them.

\{285\}
After they had been there for some time he started off.
He said to his wives,
“My mother does not let the person that stays with me last long.”
For this reason they kept sticks in their hands while he was away from them.
Some time afterward their mother-in-law put a side of mountain sheep into the fire.
She stood it up on end.
Then it caught fire.
This was the way she killed her son’s wives.
After that they kept watch on her.
When it was burning she pushed it toward her son’s wives.
Then they pushed it back upon her, and killed her.
They pulled her body outside and put something over it.
They let it stand out of the ground a very little.

Meanwhile her son was away.
When he arrived he was carrying a big mountain sheep.
Then he asked for his mother.
“She did to us just as you said.
We threw it over upon her.
We pulled her outside.”
He said to them,
“What you have done to her is well.
My mother would not let a person who lived with me last long.”
After that he collected sides of mountain sheep, inside fat, and tallow.

\{286\}
After many years had passed Mountain Dweller said to his wives,
“Wouldn’t you like to go home?”
“Yes,” said they.
{}[The elder] said to him,
“My mother said we could not marry you.
That is why we came to find you.”
“Weave some baskets,”
he said.
So they wove them.
“Weave two that you can just put on your thumbs” [he said].
They were going to start.
There were many mountains between.
After they had put many canoe loads of things inside of the baskets he put them both on his thumb, and they started along with them.
They were gone for a very few days.

When they were going along with him he seemed to be changed suddenly.
Mountain Dweller began to shine from within.
By and by they sighted their father’s town.
The town was long.
In the evening they came in front of the house.
He had the small baskets on his thumb.
Then they wished that their little brother might run out to them.
They called him to them.
The people had already
\{287\}
given a mourning feast for them there.
A year was now past.
For this reason he ran into the 
Then he said to his mother,
“My sisters have come and are outside.”
At this she became angry with her young son, who had longed for his sisters.
“You lie,”
she said to him.
At once he went back to them, crying.
When he came into the house again he said to his mother,
“They are there.
It is well that you go out to them.”
“Take a piece off of their marten blankets and bring it here,”
she said.
So he told them.
(The way I am telling you is the way people always tell old stories.)
Then he brought it into the house.
At that time his mother started out.
She looked.
Her children were really there.
“Come into the house,” she said.
So they came into the house to her.
Afterward the elder girl told her mother about the baskets.
Mountain Dweller having shaken the baskets, she said,
“There are big baskets outside.
Let them be brought in.”
Then two persons went out.
The baskets were too heavy for them.
More went out.
All the men in the house tried to bring them in.
\{288\}
When they could not, Mountain Dweller rose to get the baskets.
Although they were unable to get them, Mountain Dweller put the baskets on his third finger.
Inside was fat from the inside of a mountain sheep.
Because her mother had scratched the inside of her daughters’ cheeks, [the elder girl] invited the people for nothing but fat.
The things in the baskets were too much for them.
The baskets in which these things were contained, were called World-renowned-baskets.

The verb in (\lastx) has an unmarked third person object.
This is notable because \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s gloss “the things were taken” implies that there should be the indefinite (fourth person) nonhuman object \fm{at=} rather than the unmarked third person object.
The Tlingit sentence is thus not explicit whether the things moved are inanimate entities and thus the possessions of the visitors or whether they are animate entities and thus the visitors themselves.
The English translation “them” used here is deliberately ambiguous because it can refer to either an animate or inanimate referent.

The particle \fm{tle} is apparently focused with the particle \fm{áyú} in (\lastx), but this is not attested elsewhere.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s transcription \orth{ʟayu′} runs the two words together since it is clearly not like *\orth{ʟeayu′}, suggesting that the speaker pronounced this as something like [\ipa{tɬʰəájú}] or [\ipa{tɬʰàːjú}].
\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s gloss “then” supports this analysis as \fm{tle} + \fm{áyú}.
It is unclear if focused \fm{tle} is just accidentally unattested or if it is a unique innovation by this speaker.

Here and elsewhere the noun \fm{dachx̱án} ‘grandchild’ is given as a single, indivisible unit.
Although this is in keeping with how it is treated by modern speakers, this noun can be etymologically decomposed into something like \fm{daa-ji-x̱án} ‘around-hand-near’.
See the discussion in chapter \ref{ch:89-origin-of-copper} at sentence (\ref{ex:89-34-come-inside}) for details on the etymology of \fm{dachx̱án} ‘grandchild’.

There are five things in (\lastx) that deserve some discussion.
First there is the noun that \citeauthor{swanton:1909} transcribes as \orth{sawâ′k} and which is given here as \fm{sawáak} ‘mongrel’.
This noun is very rare today, documented only three times by \citeauthor{leer:1973}, first as \fm{sawaak} [\ipa{sa.ˈwaːk}] ‘bulldog’ in Tongass Tlingit and as \fm{sawáak} [\ipa{sà.ˈwáːk}] ‘long-eared bulldogs’ from an unknown non-Tongass source \parencite[03/275]{leer:1973}, then later as \fm{sawáak} [\ipa{sà.ˈwáːk}] ‘big dog with pointed ears, guard dog’ from Inland Northern speakers \parencite[\textsc{t}·57]{leer:2001}.
It is also known from a couple of recordings of speakers from Wrangell and Kake and is probably waiting to be found in other old recordings.
The noun \fm{sawáak} is a borrowing of Russian собака \fm{sobáka} ‘dog’ which is pronounced today as [\ipa{sɐ.ˈba.kə}] in standard Russian.
Originally \fm{sawáak} probably referred to dog breeds introduced by Russian colonists, but these would have been gone by the 1880s and so would not be salient for speakers afterward.
Since Tlingit already has a word \fm{keitl} ‘dog’ the borrowing \fm{sawáak} has taken on specialized meanings that vary from place to place.
The translation here adopts English ‘mongrel’ because it is a pejorative term for dogs and there is clearly a pejorative meaning intended here in Tlingit, but the meaning of ‘mixed breed’ is not applicable.%
\footnote{English \fm{mongrel} is probably from Proto-Germanic \fm[*]{mangjan-} ‘to mix’ > Old English \fm{mengan} > Modern English \fm{ming}; compare \fm{among}, \fm{mingle}, Old English \fm{gemong} ‘mixture, crowd’ \parencite[353]{kroonen:2013}.}
Another plausible translation is ‘mutt’ (clipped from \fm{muttonhead} ‘stupid person’), but this implies a somewhat lower register in English that does not apply to the Tlingit context here.

The second interesting thing in (\lastx) is the postnominal modifier transcribed by \citeauthor{swanton:1909} as \orth{haq!î′ts} and which is analyzed here as \fm{x̱axʼéesʼ}, though it could also plausibly be \fm{x̱axʼísʼ}.
This word based on the root \fm{\rt[¹]{xʼisʼ}} ‘matted, tangled’ \parencites[f04/47–48]{leer:1973}[748]{leer:1976}[64]{leer:1978b} which was seen earlier in reference to the octopus monster’s tangle of tentacles in chapter \ref{ch:91-future-little-slave}.
Related nouns include
\fm{du xʼéesʼi} ‘his/her matted hair’,
\fm{íx̱tʼ shaxʼéesʼi} ‘shaman’s dreadlocks’,
\fm{aasdaaxʼéesʼi} ‘tree burl’,
and \fm{jiklixʼéesʼi} ’wrist’,
and a related verb is
\fm{wudlixʼísʼ} (\fm{∅}; achievement) ‘it became tangled, matted’ \parencite[f04/47–48]{leer:1973}.
The form \fm{x̱axʼéesʼ} includes the incorporated noun \fm{x̱a-} from \fm{x̱aaw} ‘hair, fur’, seen for example in the verb \fm{x̱awdlixʼísʼ} (\fm{∅}; achievement) ‘its fur is matted’ and the nouns \fm{x̱alakʼáchʼ} ‘porcupine’ (\fm{\rt[¹]{kʼatsʼ}} ‘sharp point’) and \fm{x̱anóon} ‘brown bear’ as well as in several nouns describing types of foxes:
\fm{x̱altʼoochʼ} ‘black fox’ (\fm{\rt{tʼuchʼ}} ‘char, blacken’),
\fm{x̱aldleit} ‘white fox’ (\fm{\rt{dlet}} ‘snow’),
\fm{x̱ax̱ʼaan} ‘red fox’ (\fm{\rt{x̱ʼan}} ‘fire’),
\fm{x̱askáaxʼ} ‘cross fox’ (\fm{\rt{kaxʼ}} ‘spot’),
\fm{x̱akaneist} ‘cross fox’ (\fm{kaneist} ‘cross’ < Ru.\ крест \fm{krest} ‘cross’),
\fm{x̱akaxwaan} ‘silver fox’ (\fm{kaxwaan} ‘frost’).

The structure of the phrase \fm{hé sawáak x̱axʼéesʼch} ‘by this matted mongrel’ in (\lastx) is interesting because it is a rare case of a postnominal modifier apparently constructed from a verb.
The whole phrase is a DP with the mesio-proximal determiner \fm{hé} ‘the, this (somewhat near speaker)’ and the ergative suffix \fm{-ch} indicates that this DP is the subject.
The position of the ergative suffix after \fm{x̱axʼéesʼ} also shows that the whole of \fm{sawáak x̱axʼéesʼ} is a single constituent and therefore this modifier must be part of the DP and not outside of it.
There are only a small number of essentially frozen postnominal modifiers today, but the phrase in (\lastx) suggests that this N + V\pr{mod} construction may have been more common in the past.
The phrase \fm{yú aan kulayátʼxʼ} ‘in the length of the town’ in (\ref{ex:92-1-aristocrat-dwells-in-length-of-town}) could plausibly be another case of postnominal modification, as could sentence (\ref{ex:89-1-long-town-chief}) in chapter \ref{ch:89-origin-of-copper} and sentence (\ref{ex:90-2-along-length-starving}) in chapter \ref{ch:90-man-abandoned}.
All three of these narratives are notably by Deikeenaakʼw so this could be a construction particular to his style.

\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s transcription \orth{huyē′q} in (\lastx) suggests something like \fm{hooyeiḵ} which is ungrammatical.
It could be a mistranscription of \fm{wooyeiḵ}. 
The unusual pronunciation with [\ipa{h}] could be the performance of \fm{wooyeiḵ} with an otherwise unknown archaic speech style (maybe [\ipa{ɰ̥ù.ˈjèːq}]?)\ or perhaps an imitation of an elderly woman with a large labret that interferes with her articulation of labials \parencites[cf.][444]{de-laguna:1972}[319]{mcclellan:1975a}[245–248]{emmons:1991}[64–65]{kan:2016}.
A problem with this is that the verb is transitive and so the form \fm{aawayeiḵ} would be expected rather than \fm{wooyeiḵ}.
The \fm{wooyeiḵ} form could occur for a transitive verb but it would require that the \fm{a-} prefix is suppressed by an immediately preceding ergative suffix \fm{-ch} \parencites[25]{leer:1991}{crippen:2016}[724]{crippen:2019}.
Although the phrase \fm{hé sawáak x̱axʼéesʼch} does have the ergative suffix \fm{-ch}, there is an intervening PP \fm{ax̱ jeetx̱} which should normally prevent the \fm{-ch} from suppressing \fm{a-}.
Although there are a few ‘small’ elements that can occur between \fm{-ch} and a suppressed \fm{a-} – e.g.\ \fm{yéi=} ‘thus’ – the PP \fm{ax̱ jeetx̱} is normally too ‘big’ to be transparent for this phenomenon.
It is unclear whether the speaker allowed for larger phrases to be transparent, if this was a production error, or if it is an error introduced by \citeauthor{swanton:1909} or the typesetters.
The form has ben changed to \fm{aawayeiḵ} to accord with current Tlingit grammar with a caveat that this is still not fully understood.

The phrase \fm{ax̱ jeetx̱ aawayeiḵ} in (\lastx) literally means something like ‘s/he/it bit it from my possession’.
The PP \fm{ax̱ jeetx̱} and the long low tone \fm{-μμL} stem \fm{–yeiḵ} imply either of the motion derivations \fm{NP-dáx̱} (\fm{g}; \fm{-ch} repetitive) ‘starting off, picking up from NP’ or \fm{NP-dáx̱} (\fm{n}; \fm{yoo=i-…-k} repetitive) ‘away from NP’.
The root \fm{\rt[²]{ÿeḵ}} \~\ \fm{\rt[²]{ÿiḵ}} ‘bite’ supports a basic verb \fm{aawaÿeeḵ} (\fm{g}; achievement) ‘s/he/it bit him/her/it’, imperative \fm{gayeeḵ} ‘bite it!’ \parencites[03/236]{leer:1973}[217]{leer:1976}.
It is also attested in several forms that imply it is a motion verb such as
\fm{át aawayeeḵ} “it carried it around in its mouth” \parencites[03/236]{leer:1973},
\fm{sʼaaḵ yaa anayíḵ} “it (dog) is carrying a bone in its mouth” \parencite[43.443]{story-naish:1973},
and \fm{dóosh yádi shayeit káa yan aawayíḵ} “the cat put her kitten on the pillow” \parencite[163.2234]{story-naish:1973}.
The root thus has a basic meaning of ‘bite’ and an extended meaning ‘carry in mouth’ as a handling verb.
The handling meaning is generally distinguished from the basic meaning by the addition of motion derivations, here specifically \fm{NP-dáx̱} (\fm{n}; \fm{yoo=i-…-k} repetitive) ‘away from NP’.

\citeauthor{swanton:1909} gives (\lastx) and (\nextx) as a single sentence but this does not make sense.
The phrase in (\lastx) is a main clause form so it appears to be a separate sentence.
The phrase in (\nextx) has a DP \fm{hasdu x̱ʼa.eetí} preceding a focus particle \fm{sáyú} which normally only happens at the left edge of a sentence.
And then the verb \fm{daaḵ kawdudzi.aat} is also a main clause form so this also appears to be a separate sentence.

The form of the verb in (\lastx) is unusual for two reasons which may or may not be related.
The \fm{s-} prefix occurs here in \fm{kawdudzi.aat} where we expect \fm{l-}.
This is because the \fm{s-} is normally used with \fm{\rt[¹]{.at}} ‘pl.\ go’ for either a simple causative like \fm{has awsi.aat} ‘s/he made them go’ and \fm{has ajiwsi.aat} ‘s/he sent them to fight’ or otherwise for the unique verb describing a creature (e.g.\ insect) crawling like \fm{kawsi.aat} ‘it crawled’%
\footnote{Examples of this relatively obscure verb include
\fm{a kanax̱ kansi.aat} “ants walking across”,
\fm{a káx̱ kawsi.aat} “(gumboots) are moving around on a rock” \parencite[02/78]{leer:1973}.
Also compare the nominalizations
\fm{kanas.aat} \~\ \fm{at kanas.aadí} “crawling insect; spider” \parencite[02/78]{leer:1973}.}
\parencite[92]{leer:1976}.
The \fm{l-} is much more widespread in its use with \fm{\rt[¹]{.at}} ‘pl.\ go’ for verbs that describe the position or handling of plural objects \parencites[02/79–95]{leer:1973}[92–96]{leer:1976}.
The context in (\lastx) appears to involve handling, but \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s transcription of \orth{ka′odudziāt} unambiguously indicates \fm{dzi} [\ipa{tsì}] rather than \fm{dli} [\ipa{tɬì}] and thus \fm{s-} not \fm{l-}.

The other unusual feature of the verb in (\lastx) is its stem variation.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909} has the stem \orth{āt} which suggests either a long low tone \fm{–.aat} [\ipa{ʔàːt}] with \fm{-μμL} or a long high tone \fm{–.áat} [\ipa{ʔáːt}] with \fm{-μμH}.
The long high tone \fm{–.áat} is expected to be ungrammatical for the root \fm{\rt[¹]{.at}} in a perfective aspect form, so long low tone \fm{–.aat} is the only reasonable reading for \orth{āt}.
But the verb word is preceded by \orth{dāq} which could be \fm{daak=} ‘out to sea, out into open, falling from sky, onto fire’ or alternatively \fm{daaḵ=} ‘inland, back from open, off of fire’ \parencite[297]{leer:1991}.
In this context it is probably \fm{daak=} ‘out into open’ which describes moving the emptied box of tallow out into open from its storage location.
Regardless of which preverb is used here, both are part of motion derivations that always assign the \fm{∅}-conjugation class to the verb.
The affirmative main clause \fm{∅}-conjugation class perfective aspect stem for the root \fm{\rt[¹]{.at}} is expected to be the short high tone \fm{–.át} [\ipa{ʔát}] with \fm{-μH}.
This is obviously at odds with the long low tone \fm{–.aat} [\ipa{ʔàːt}] suggested by \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s transcription.
There are three motion derivations that do not add any preverbs, PPs, or prefixes to the verb  but which shift the conjugation class to \fm{n}, \fm{g̱}, or \fm{g}-conjugation respectively \parencite[306, 308, 309]{leer:1991}.
These have the basic meanings of ‘lateral, horizontal’ (\fm{n}), ‘falling, downward’ (\fm{g̱}), and ‘starting off, picking up, upward’ (\fm{g}).
Although these might seem like an appealing solution to the unusual stem, none of these three motion derivations have any obvious semantic contributions in this context.
The form in (\lastx) has been given instead with the short high tone \fm{-μH} stem matching the expected \fm{∅}-conjugation class.

The sentence in (\lastx) is very similar to (\ref{ex:92-15-nothing-inside-it}).
One difference is the appearance here of \fm{tléil} where (\ref{ex:92-15-nothing-inside-it}) instead has \fm{tléikʼ}.
Normally these two particles – the negative statement \fm{tléikʼ} ‘no’ and the negation particle \fm{tléil} ‘not’ – are not interchangeable.
It seems from these two sentences that this was possible in the past.
This adds a wrinkle for (\lastx) in that it appears to have two negatives, something which is not normally found in Tlingit.
A literal translation might be “after that there is not apparently no thing sitting within it”.
Both sentences need more investigation.

\citeauthor{swanton:1909} transcribes the word for ‘dish’ as \orth{s!ī′q!} in (\ref{ex:92-25-dishes-made-all-hairy}) which implies a form like \fm[?]{sʼéexʼ} [\ipa{sʼíːxʼ}] with a long vowel.
This word is otherwise only documented as \fm{sʼíxʼ} [\ipa{sʼíxʼ}] with a short vowel.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909} gives the same word as \orth{s!î′q!} in (\ref{ex:92-35-put-down-hairy-dishes-in-their-places}) and (\ref{ex:92-42-have-dishes-in-place}).
It is not clear if \citeauthor{swanton:1909} meant to write \orth{s!î′q!} here or if the speaker really did use a long vowel.
Because this is a very common and well documented word, the form in (\ref{ex:92-25-dishes-made-all-hairy}) is given as \fm{sʼíxʼ} with the implied assumption that \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s transcription is incorrect.

\citeauthor{swanton:1909} ran together the sentences in (\ref{ex:92-33-they-slept}) and (\ref{ex:92-34-dug-beneath-boards}).
The verbs in both (\ref{ex:92-33-they-slept}) and (\ref{ex:92-34-dug-beneath-boards}) are clearly main clause forms, implying they are separate sentences.
The sentence in (\ref{ex:92-34-dug-beneath-boards}) has a focused PP \fm{taat áyú} ‘it is at night’ which is expected at the beginning of a sentence, but not following a main clause verb.
Finally, the two make sense as separate events in sequence, with everyone going to sleep first and then the girls and doing their digging having implicitly either woken up or feigned sleep.

The modifier PP \fm{a tʼáak} in (\lastx) has a third person nonhuman possessor \fm{a}.
The referent of this could be the house in which the girls and their family implicitly dwell.
Alternatively, the referent could be the family, in which case the nonhuman would be used as a kind of obviative because the family are currently background characters.
The English translation of ‘behind them’ adopts the latter interpretation because it is more natural in English than ‘behind it’ would be since the house has not been explicitly mentioned.

\FIXME{Subject is mother following \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s editorial addition.
The verb is clearly transitive although \citeauthor{swanton:1909} mistakenly took it as intransitive.
The referent of the object is unclear.
Could be the grandmother, or maybe the husband.
Or nobody in particular?
But the object is not explicitly indefinite (fourth person).
The English translation has to have some sort of gender and number for the object so we are forced to choose between ‘him’, ‘her’, and ‘them’.}

The phrase that \citeauthor{swanton:1909} transcribes as \orth{naade′ ỵa-} in (\lastx) can be analyzed in two ways.
One analysis is as a relative clause \fm{aadé has na.ádi ÿé} ‘the way that they are going there’.
In this analysis the \orth{e′} is the relative clause suffix \fm{-i} and the \orth{ỵa-} is the noun \fm{ÿé} ‘way, place, manner, time’ that heads the relative clause.
The other analysis is as a subordinate clause \fm{aadé has na.aadí áÿá} ‘while/which they are going there’.
In this analysis the \orth{e′} is the subordinate clause suffix \fm{-í} and the \orth{ỵa-} reflects the focus particle \fm{áÿá}, perhaps blended together with the subordinate clause as something like [\ipa{…íá.ɰá}] without the expected glottal stop between them.
Both structures are ‘insubordinate’ in that they would be expected to be elements subordinate to some main clause matrix but instead appear without an obvious main clause \parencite{cable:2011}.
The narrative context does not provide much support for favouring one or the other of these two analyses.
The relative clause analysis is given in (\lastx) because it fully interprets the transcribed material and does not require any missing additions, i.e.\ there is no hidden \fm{á}.
One additional argument in favour of the relative clause analysis is that \citeauthor{swanton:1909} might have been expected to write something like ?\orth{naā′de} for the subordinate \fm{na.aadí}, but this argument is weak because he is not entirely reliable in distinguishing short and long vowels.

The verb in (\lastx) is not attested elsewhere and seems to be peculiar.
Both \fm{yéi aÿawsiḵaa} (\fm{n}; \fm{x̱ʼe-…-μH} activity) ‘s/he said so to him/her’ and \fm{yéi adaaÿaawaḵaa} (\fm{n}; \fm{-μH} activity) ‘s/he said so about/to him/her; s/he told him/her so’ are well attested \parencite[856, 858]{leer:1976}.
The verb in (\lastx) appears to be a combination of these two verbs, with the \fm{s-} of one and the \fm{daa-} of the other.
In addition the transcription \orth{hᴀs daỵa′osîqa} suggests \fm{has daaÿawsiḵaa} without the expected \fm{a-} for the third person object and subject.
The lack of the \fm{a-} prefix could be attributed to mistranscription, but the combination of \fm{daa-} and \fm{s-} is not so easily waved away.
The translation as ‘she said to them’ is straightforward from the context and from \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s interpretation, but this is probably missing some nuance that is still to be decoded from the Tlingit form.

\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s use of a hyphen in \orth{Ca-idaqê} might seem surprising here.
Although it could be interpreted from a modern perspective as indicating a prefix, this would not be consistent with his lack of affix segmentation elsewhere.
More likely he meant to indicate the absence of a distinct word boundary, consistent with his use of the hyphen in other contexts like
the relative clause in (\ref{ex:92-35-put-down-hairy-dishes-in-their-places})
and
the possessive phrase in (\ref{ex:92-36-went-inside-tree-hole-behind}).
In those uses he probably marks the lack of a phonological word division that he otherwise expected, similar to the undertie symbol [\ipa{‿}] ‘absence of a break’ in the IPA \parencite[23]{international-phonetic-association:1999} which is often used to reflect cliticization or liason without commitment to morphological representation.
Crucially this means that the hyphen in \orth{Ca-idaqê} does not indicate a glottal stop [\ipa{ʔ}] and thus that there is no word boundary between [\ipa{ʃa}] and [\ipa{i}].
This fits with the form being an imperative with an overt second person plural subject \fm{ÿi-} which would normally be pronounced [\ipa{ʃàj.tà.ˈqʰé}] by Sitka Tlingit speakers today.
If \citeauthor{swanton:1909} had committed to the coda [\ipa{j}] as a vowel [\ipa{i}] then he was confronted with a sequence of [\ipa{a}] and [\ipa{i}].
Since \citeauthor{swanton:1909} usually did not transcribe glottal stops with a distinct symbol and instead relied on their implicit presence between vowels, his transcription as \orth{ai} would entail a glottal stop [\ipa{aʔi}].
\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s hyphen avoids this by suggesting the lack of a word boundary;
in this context it effectively marks the absence of a glottal stop.
His hyphen is thus an artifact of his phonetic transcription and is not meant to have any morphological significance.

The sentence in (\ref{ex:92-41-length-would-move}) presents some difficulties for translating it into English.
The verb \fm{nashx̱énch} is a habitual aspect form (\fm{\xx{cnj}-…-ch}) based on the root \fm{\rt[¹]{x̱in}} \~\ \fm{\rt[¹]{x̱en}} ‘container move through space, fall’ \parencites[f02/28–30]{leer:1973}[796]{leer:1976}.
It is modified by the pathless motion derivation (\fm{n}; \fm{yoo=i-…-k} repetitive) ‘laterally, horizontally’ which provides the \fm{n}-conjugation class so that the habitual selects the \fm{n-} conjugation prefix.
The \fm{d-} and \fm{sh-} prefixes are present in all verbs based on this root.
Their functions are unclear, but the \fm{d-} is plausibly a kind of ‘self-affecting’ middle and the \fm{sh-} may be originally pejorative because most verbs describe physically unstable situations such as spilling, capsizing, dislocating that could be perceived as undesirable.
Because the root seems to have the specific meaning of a container – e.g.\ pot, canoe – there is an implicit identification of the dishes used as decoys for the absent girls.
This implication is difficult to render in English without a complex circumlocution and so has been left untranslated.

A second problem for translating the sentence in (\ref{ex:92-41-length-would-move}) is that it  lacks some implicit context.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s translation “Then the long dishes moved [as she pulled at the covers]” includes a signficant editorial addition.
The movement in (\ref{ex:92-41-length-would-move}) is not that of inanimate objects come to life, but rather is induced by the mother who is disturbing the bed.
This additional information is otherwise nowhere to be found in the Tlingit narrative and is not obviously inferred from the context.
It has been added to the English translation by simply copying \citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s interpolation.

Finally, the nominalization \fm{kuwáatʼ} ‘length’ in (\ref{ex:92-41-length-would-move}) deserves some comment.
This is based on the comparative form \fm{yéi koowáatʼ} ‘it is comparatively long’ of the dimension-denoting state verb \fm{yaÿátʼ} (\fm{n}; \fm{-μH} state) ‘it is long’.
The nominalization process predictably suppressses the \fm{i-} stative prefix; the absence of the comparative argument – e.g.\ the default \fm{yéi=} ‘thus’ – is presumably also due to nominalization.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909} translates \fm{kuwáatʼ} as “the long dishes” rather than just ‘length’.
It is plausible that \fm{kuwáatʼ} could refer to the \fm{sʼíxʼ} dishes by synechdoche.
But it is equally reasonable in this context to take \fm{kuwáatʼ} to refer to the length of the bed or the length of the covers.
\citeauthor{swanton:1909}’s translation could be informed by his consultants, but he could also have added his interpretation without input from them.
The English translation simply uses ‘length‘ without explanation, leaving the interpretation up to context just as in the Tlingit original.

The main verb in (\lastx) has an idiomatic meaning in this context that is not entirely clear in its translation.
The root \fm{\rt[²]{g̱ich}} ‘throw pl.’ has a basic sense of ‘throw, toss, pitch plural objects’ in the verb \fm{ag̱éech} (\fm{∅}/\fm{n}; \fm{-μμH} activity) ‘s/he is throwing, tossing, pitching them’ \parencite[842]{leer:1976}.
The addition of extensional \fm{l-} gives the verb \fm{alg̱eech} (\fm{n}/\fm{∅}; \fm{-μμL} activity, \fm{-t} repetitive) ‘s/he fells it (tree)’ \parencite[843]{leer:1976}.
The addition of the qualifier \fm{ÿ-} (‘face’?) and antipassive \fm{d-} gives the verb \fm{ÿawdig̱eech} (motion) ‘s/he/it moved point first’ \parencite[844]{leer:1976}.
Motion derivations can further restrict this meaning as in \fm{át ÿawdig̱ích} (\fm{∅}; \fm{-μμL} repetitive) ‘it (point of sharp object) poked, pricked, stabbed into it’.
Relevant here is the verb \fm{anax̱ yawdig̱ích} (\fm{∅}) ‘it pierced through it’ \parencite[844]{leer:1976} which is unusual because although it features the PP \fm{NP-náx̱} which suggests the \fm{n}-conjugation motion derivation \fm{NP-náx̱} (\fm{n}; \fm{yoo=i-…-k} repetitive) ‘by way of, through NP’, the perfective aspect form has the stem \fm{–g̱ích} with \fm{-μH} that suggests the \fm{∅}-conjugation class instead.
Regardless of this peculiarity, the meaning ‘pierce inland through it’ in (\lastx) idiomatically describes the movement of a group of people.
The people are taken as a singular group object whose metaphoric sharp point at the front of the group pierces through the hole and moves inland.
Compare \citeauthor{leer:1991}’s discussion of the verb \fm{has loowagooḵ} (motion) ‘they ran’ (based on \fm{\rt[²]{guḵ}} ‘push’) which contains the incorporated \fm{lu-} ‘nose’ that “evokes the elongated ovoid shape characteristic of a group running” \parencite[51]{leer:1991}.

\FIXME{Detail this uncommon verb.
See \cite[03/332–333]{leer:1973} and \cite[108.1410]{story-naish:1973} where it is misleadingly translated as ‘pity’ and ‘hesitate to say’.
\cite[240–241]{leer:1976} has an explanatory note from JM that confirms its meaning.
\cite[15]{leer:1978b} confirms the meaning and connects it to Eyak \fm{ʔyahɢ}.
The root \fm{\rt[²]{wu⁽ʼ⁾ḵ}} is attested as both \fm{–wóoḵ} and \fm{–wooḵ} in stems where \fm{-μμL} is expected, so it varies between glottal and not, probably depending on the dialect or speaker.
Tongass has \fm{–woòḵ} [\ipa{wuʰq}] \parencite[03/333]{leer:1973}
and Angoon has \fm{–wooḵ} [\ipa{wùːq}] \parencite[108.1410]{story-naish:1973},
but Leer’s early stem file (prob.\ Juneau) has \fm{–wóoḵ} \parencite[90]{leer:1963}
as does his later data \parencite[03/333]{leer:1973}.}
